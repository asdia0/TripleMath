\begin{problem}
    The product moment correlation coefficient is denoted by $r$. Comment on the validity of following:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $r=0$ for a set of data $(x,y)$ implies $x$ and $y$ are unrelated.
        \item If $x$ is the number of cigarettes smoked per day by lung cancer patients and $y$ is the age of the lung cancer patients at death, then $r=-0.9$ implies that smoking more cigarettes per day causes lung cancer patients to die at a younger age.
        \item The value of $r$ for a sample $(x,y)$ being 1 means that a linear relation holds for $x$ and $y$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{ppart}
        False. $r = 0$ implies that $x$ and $y$ are not linearly correlated; $x$ and $y$ could be related by another model (e.g. quadratic).
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        False. Though $r = -0.9$ implies that $x$ and $y$ have a strong negative linear correlation, it does not imply a causal relationship between $x$ and $y$.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        False. If $r = 1$, we can say that a linear relation holds for $x$ and $y$ within the range provided by the sample. However, outside this range, we cannot say that $x$ and $y$ still share a linear relationship.
    \end{ppart}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    For a random sample of 12 observations of pairs of values ($x$, $y$), the equation of the regression line of $y$ on $x$ is $y=4.82-2.25x$. The sum of the 12 values of $x$ is 20.64 and the product moment correlation coefficient for the sample is $-0.3$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the sum of the 12 values of $y$.
        \item Find the estimated value of $y$ when $x=2.8$ and comment on the reliability of this estimate.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Note that $\ol{x} = 20.64/12 = 1.72$. Since $\bp{\ol{x}, \ol{y}}$ lies on the regression line, we have \[\ol{y} = 4.82 - 2.25\bp{1.72} = 0.95,\] so the sum of the 12 values of $y$ is $12\bp{0.95} = 11.4$.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        When $x = 2.8$, we have \[y = 4.82 - 2.25\bp{2.8} = -1.48.\] Since $\abs{r} = 0.3$, there is a weak linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, so the estimate is unreliable.
    \end{ppart}
\end{ppart}

\begin{problem}
    With the aid of suitable scatter diagrams, describe the differences between the least squares linear regression line of $y$ on $x$ and that of $x$ on $y$. Show clearly on these diagrams, the distances which are used to draw the least squares linear regression lines from 5 data points. Explain why these distances are squared.

    The least squares linear regression line of $x$ on $y$ is the line that minimizes the squares of the horizontal distances (dotted lines) between the data points to the line.

    The regression lines aim to minimize the ``distance'' between the line and the data points. This is equivalent to minimizing the squared deviations. Hence, the distances (deviations) are squared.

\begin{problem}
    An engineering company makes cranes. The numbers, $x$, sold in each three-month period for two years, together with the profits, $y$ thousand dollars, on the sale of these cranes are given in the following table.

        Using G.C., the equation of the regression line of $y$ on $x$ is $y = 17.083x + 53.333$. Each additional crane yields a profit of \$17 083.

        Using the regression line of $y$ on $x$ at $x = 20$, we have \[y = 17.083\bp{20} + 53.333 = 395,\] so the corresponding profit is \$395 000.

\begin{problem}
    A study was carried out to investigate possible links between the weights of hens ($x$ kg) and their eggs ($y$ g). A sample of 15 hens was chosen at random and the weights of these hens and their eggs were noted. The scatter diagram and the summarized information for the sample are shown below. The linear product moment coefficient was also computed and found to be 0.200.

    By referring to the scatter diagram and the given value of the linear product moment correlation coefficient, comment on the appropriateness of a linear model.

    One of the points, $(4, 16)$, was identified as an outlier and removed.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For the remaining sample of size 14, recalculate the values in the table above and determine the value of the linear product moment correlation coefficient. Show your workings clearly.
        \item Use a suitable regression line to estimate the weight of an egg laid by a hen weighing 4 kg, giving your answer to the nearest grams.
        \item Comment on the reliability of your answer.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{ppart}
        We have
        \begin{gather*}
            \sum x = 33.9 - 4 = 29.9,\\
            \sum x^2 = 85.99 - 4^2 = 69.99,\\
            \sum y = 690 - 16 = 674,\\
            \sum y^2 = 34432 - 16^2 = 34176,\\
            \sum xy = 1591.2 - (4)(16) = 1527.2,
        \end{gather*}
        so \[r = \frac{\sum xy - \frac1{n} \sum x \sum y}{\sqrt{\bs{\sum x^2 - \frac1n \bp{\sum x}^2} \bs{\sum y^2 - \frac1n \bp{\sum y}^2}}} = 0.852.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        The equation of the regression line $y$ on $x$ is given by \[y - \ol{y} = b \bp{x - \ol{x}},\] where \[b = \frac{\sum xy - \frac1{n} \sum x \sum y}{\sum x^2 - \frac1n \bp{\sum x}^2} = 14.3063.\] Thus, \[y = 14.306x + 17.589.\] At $x = 4$, $y = 75$, so the weight of an egg laid by a hen weighing 4 kg is approximately 75 g.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        $x = 4$ is outside the given range of values (since we removed the point $(4, 16)$). Thus, the estimate is an extrapolation and is hence unreliable.

        The equation of the regression line $\ln t$ on $x$ is \[\ln t = -0.39512 x + 801.67.\] At $x = 2010$, we have $t = \e^{2.43589} = 11.426$. Hence, the model predicts the world recorded time, at 1st January 2010, to be 3 minutes and 41 seconds.

        $y$ is increasing at a decreasing rate, not at a constant rate as a linear model would suggest.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        $c$ is negative since the rate of increase is decreasing. $d$ is positive since the $y$-values are positive.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Using G.C., $r = -0.97955$. The regression line of $y$ on $1/x$ is \[y = \frac{-17.484}{x} + 91.750.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        At $x = 3$, $y = 85.9$. $x = 3$ is within the given range of values ($1 \leq x \leq 50$), so the estimate is an interpolation. Further, $\abs{r}$ is close to 1. Thus, the estimate is reliable.

\begin{problem}
    An athletic coach believes that athletes with longer legs can run faster. He selected 10 of his athletes and recorded their leg lengths, $x$ metres and their times, $t$ seconds, in a 100 m race. The results are given in the table.
        
    \begin{table}[H]

        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
            $x$ & 0.70 & 0.76 & 0.80 & 0.84 & 0.85 & 0.89 & 0.92 & 0.95 & 0.98 & 1.00 \\ \hline
            $t$ & 13.90 & 12.73 & 12.12 & 11.89 & 11.80 & 11.42 & 11.29 & 10.94 & 11.00 & 10.80 \\ \hline

    It is given that the value of the product moment correlation coefficient for this data is $-0.963$, correct to 3 decimal places.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item State, with a reason, whether the value of the product moment correlation coefficient would be different if the leg lengths had been measured in centimetres instead.
        \item One of the athletes, Aaron, had missed the race. Assuming a linear model, the coach decides to use a regression line to estimate Aaron's 100 m race timing by measuring his leg length. Explain which of the least squares regression lines, $x$ on $t$ or $t$ on $x$, should be used.
        \item Draw a scatter diagram to illustrate the data.
        \item Aaron disagreed with the coach and claimed that $x$ and $t$ do not have a linear correlation. Comment on Aaron's statement with reference to the scatter diagram.
        \item To be fair to Aaron, the coach considered another possible model for the relationship between $x$ and $t$: $t= a + b/x^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the value of the product moment correlation coefficient between $t$ and $1/x^2$, and hence explain why this new model is better than the linear model.
            \item The coach wants to train an athlete to run the 100 m race in 10 seconds. Calculate the equation of the regression line based on the new model, and use it to estimate the minimum leg length required for the potential athlete. Comment on the reliability of the estimate.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{ppart}
        $r$ is invariant under scaling, hence $r$ will remain the same even if the leg lengths were measured in cm.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Since the leg length ($x$) is given, he should use the regression line of $t$ on $x$.

        $t$ seems to approach a limiting value as $x$ increases. Hence, Aaron's statement is correct.

    \begin{ppart}
        \begin{psubpart}
            Using G.C., $r = 0.9951$. Since $\abs{r}$ is now closer to 1 ($0.9951 > 0.963$), the new model is better than the linear model.

        \begin{psubpart}
            The regression line $t$ on $1/x^2$ is given by \[t = \frac{2.8616}{x^2} + 7.8603.\] When $t = 10$, we have $x = 1.16$. Since $t$ is outside the given range of values ($10.80 \leq t \leq 13.90$), the estimate is an extrapolation and thus unreliable.
