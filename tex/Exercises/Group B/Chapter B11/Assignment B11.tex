\begin{problem}
    Show that if $f$ is differentiable at $(x_0, y_0)$ and $\nabla f(x_0, y_0) \neq \vec 0$, then $\nabla f(x_0, y_0)$ is perpendicular to the level curve of $f$ through $(x_0, y_0)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    Let $f(x, y) = (x(t), y(t))$. Let the level curve at $(x_0, y_0)$ have equation $f(x, y) = c$. Implicitly differentiating this with respect to $t$, we get \[\pder{f}{x} \der{x}{t} + \pder{f}{y} \der{y}{t} = \cvecii{f_x}{f_y} \dotp \cvecii{\derx{x}{t}}{\derx{y}{t}} = \nabla f \dotp \vec u = 0,\] where $\vec u$ is the tangent to the level curve at $(x_0, y_0)$. Since both $\nabla f$ and $\vec u$ are non-zero vectors, they must be perpendicular to each other.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Find the quadratic approximation of $f(x, y) = \e^{x^2 + y^2}$ around the point $\bp{\frac12, 0}$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    Observe that we have
    \begin{gather*}
        f_x(x, y) = 2x\e^{x^2 + y^2}, \quad f_y(x, y) = 2y\e^{x^2 + y^2}\\
        f_{xx}(x, y) = 2\e^{x^2 + y^2}(2x^2 + 1), \quad f_{xy}(x, y) = 4xy\e^{x^2 + y^2}, \quad f_{yy}(x, y) = 2\e^{x^2 + y^2}(2y^2 + 1).
    \end{gather*}
    Evaluating $f(x, y)$ and the above partial derivatives at $\bp{\frac12, 0}$, we obtain
    \begin{gather*}
        f(x, y) = \e^{1/4}, \quad f_x(x, y) = \e^{1/4}, \quad f_y(x, y) = 0\\
        f_{xx}(x, y) = 3\e^{1/4}, \quad f_{xy}(x, y) = 0, \quad f_{yy}(x, y) = 2\e^{1/4}.
    \end{gather*}
    The quadratic approximation $Q(x, y)$ to $f(x, y)$ at $\bp{\frac12, 0}$ is hence \[Q(x, y) = \e^{1/4} + \e^{1/4}\bp{x - \frac12} + 3\e^{1/4} \bp{x - \frac12}^2 + \e^{1/4} y^2.\]
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    A common problem in experimental work is to obtain a mathematical relationship between two variables $x$ and $y$ by ``fitting'' a curve to points in the plane corresponding to various experimentally determines values of $x$ and $y$, say \[(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), \ldots, (x_n, y_n).\] Based on theoretical considerations, or simply on the pattern of the points, one decides on the general form of the curve to be fitted. Often, the ``curve'' to be fitted is a straight line, $y = ax + b$. One criterion for selecting a line of ``best fit'' is to choose $a$ and $b$ to minimize the function \[f(a, b) = \sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k + b - y_k)^2.\] Geometrically, $\abs{ax_k + b - y_k}$ is the vertical distance between the data point $(x_k, y_k)$ and the line $y = ax + b$, so in effect, minimizing $f(a, b)$ minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. This procedure is called the method of least squares.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the conditions $\pderx{f}{a} = 0$ and $\pderx{f}{b} = 0$ result in the equations
        \begin{align*}
            \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2} a + \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k} b &= \sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k y_k)\\
            \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k} a + nb &= \sum_{k = 1}^n y_k
        \end{align*}
        \item Solve the equations for $a$ and $b$ to show that \[a = \frac{n\sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k y_k) - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n y_k}}{n\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2}\] and \[b = \frac{\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2}\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n y_k} - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k y_k)}}{n\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2}.\]
        \item Given that $\bar{x} =  \frac1n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k$, show that $ n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2 > 0$.
        \item Find $f_{aa}(a, b)$, $f_{bb}(a, b)$ and $f_{ab}(a, b)$.
        \item Show that $f$ has a relative minimum at the critical point found in (b).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{ppart}
        Observe that \[\pder{f}{a} = \pder{}{a} \sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k + b - y_k)^2 = \sum_{k = 1}^n 2x_k(ax_k + b - y_k) = 2\sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k^2 + bx_k - x_ky_k).\] Hence, \[\pder{f}{a} = 2\sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k^2 + bx_k - x_ky_k) = 0 \implies a \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 + b \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k = \sum_{k = 1}^n x_ky_k.\]

        Observe that \[\pder{f}{b} = \pder{}{b} \sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k + b - y_k)^2 = \sum_{k = 1}^n 2(ax_k + b - y_k) = 2\bs{\sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k - y_k) + bn}.\] Hence, \[\pder{f}{b} = 2\bs{\sum_{k = 1}^n (ax_k - y_k) + bn} = 0 \implies a \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k + bn = \sum_{k = 1}^n y_k.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Let \[A = \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2, \quad B = \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k, \quad C = \sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k y_k), \quad D = n, \quad E = \sum_{k = 1}^n y_k.\] The above equations transform into \[\systeme{Aa + Bb = C, Ba + Db = E}.\] One can easily solve the system for $a$ and $b$, yielding \[a = \frac{CD - BE}{AD - B^2}, \quad b = \frac{AE - BC}{AD - B^2}.\] Thus, \[a = \frac{n\sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k y_k) - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n y_k}}{n\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2}\] and \[b = \frac{\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2}\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n y_k} - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}\bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n (x_k y_k)}}{n\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2}.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Observe that \[\bar{x} =  \frac1n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k \implies \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k = n \bar{x}.\] Consider $ n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2$.
        \begin{gather*}
            n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2 = n \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - n\bar{x}^2} = n \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - 2n\bar{x}^2 + n\bar{x}^2} \\
            = n \bs{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - 2n\bar{x} \bp{\frac1n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k} + \sum_{k = 1}^n \bar{x}^2} = n \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \sum_{k = 1}^n 2x_k\bar{x} + \sum_{k = 1}^n \bar{x}^2} \\
            = n \sum_{k = 1}^n \bp{x_k^2 -  2x_k\bar{x} + \bar{x}^2} = n \sum_{k = 1}^n \bp{x_k - \bar{x}}^2.
        \end{gather*}
        Given that the RHS is a sum of squares, it must be greater than or equal to 0. We thus have the inequality \[n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2 \geq 0.\] However, if $ n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2 = 0$, then both $a$ and $b$ would be undefined. Thus, we must have a strict inequality, which gives \[n \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2 > 0.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        From (a), we have \[f_a(a, b) = 2a \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 + 2b \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k - 2\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k y_k\] and \[f_b(a, b) = 2a\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k + 2nb - 2\sum_{k = 1}^n y_k.\] Thus, \[f_{aa}(a, b) = 2 \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2, \qquad f_{ab}(a, b) = 2 \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k, \qquad f_{bb}(a, b) = 2n.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Let $D = f_{aa}(a, b) f_{bb}(a, b) - \bs{f_{ab}(a, b)}^2$. From part (d), we have \[D = 4\bs{n\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2 - \bp{\sum_{k = 1}^n x_k}^2},\] which is clearly positive from part (c). Furthermore, $f_{aa}(a, b) =  2 \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k^2$ is clearly positive (note that we reject the equality for the reason stated in part (c)). Thus, by the second partial derivative test, the critical point found in part (b) must be a minimum point.
    \end{ppart}
